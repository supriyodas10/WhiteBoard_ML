# WhiteBoard_ML
The White Board is a Machine Learning driven application that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures. This project leverages computer vision techniques to detect and track hand movements, enabling the creation of drawings or writings on a virtual canvas without the need for physical contact with a traditional whiteboard or paper.
